  1. Read subtitile text with pysrt.
  2. Construct word and phrases list by greedely searching them into Muellers
  (or other) dictionary. If needed hacks with chaning word form will be 
  applied (like removing trailing -s, -es, -ed, etc). See
  <https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Natural_language_processing>.
  3. Compare with list of known words and phrases and output new words.
