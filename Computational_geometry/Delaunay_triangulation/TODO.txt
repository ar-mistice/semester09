 * Fix TODO from sources.
 * Add tests for points exact predicates.
 * Implement exact predicates inexactly but without use of CGAL
(by using Boost.Interval I suppose).
 * Add tests for different triangulations.
 * Implement correct testing structure using SCons.
 * Currently multiple valid results are possible, as in simple_4v.in.
 * Add tests for checking Delaunay property.
